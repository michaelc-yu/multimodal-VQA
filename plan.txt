Bottom-up attention is implemented with Faster R-CNN

Steps:
-load a pre-trained ResNet-101 model
-train a region-proposal network to predict object classes and bounding boxes
-use greedy non-maximum suppressoin with IoU threshold to select top box proposals
-use region of interest pooling to extract small feature map for each box


Top-down attention

-uses contextual information from a question about an image to weight the importance of the features extracted by the 
bottom-up process
